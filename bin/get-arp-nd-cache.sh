# addresses associated with a given users device.

# creates text files for the complementary user-id population script to do its
# thing. also assumes that the home network is dual-stack enabled though it
# should work just fine in an IPv4 only environment.
#
# one text file per MAC address is created to allow the user-id script to deal
# with stale entries and active entries as appropriate.

# dependencies:
# shyaml (https://github.com/0k/shyaml) - a nice tool to let shell scripts
# read YAML files for configuration info.

# also assumes that you've taken the necessary steps to secure the execution
# of commands on your routing device.
